Pacman

A light version of the game, where a character is moving on a 2D game table with
the purpose of getting to the finishing point trying to avoid the fixed and 
moving obstacles, whose coordinates are changing depending on the player's own position.

Function "move_character" reads the next move , modifies the coordinates of the 
player and returns 1 if press "q" on the keyboard or 0 otherwise.
Function "is_the_game_ended" verifies the player's coordinates in the corner from
south-east.

- It needs to be verified if the player overlaps an obstacel before calculatint the
new positions of the mobile obstacles before and after.

If the game is finished successfully, the text 'GAME COMPLETED' is shown.
